## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.14] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **"Chat through it with Claude" prompt now handles install.sh** — the v0.1.13 README mentioned tiers but the agent-driven walkthrough prompt still only did `git clone` + handoff to `/bootstrap`, silently skipping the CCv4 tooling install in the same way the old README did. v0.1.14 patches the prompt template so Claude (the agent) asks the user which tier they want, then runs `./scripts/install.sh --skip-api-keys` (Full) or `./scripts/install.sh --no-fastedit-model --skip-api-keys` (Lite CCv4) for them — bypassing the interactive 5-key stdin prompts that would otherwise block. After install completes, the prompt instructs the user to fill in `.env` manually + run `/mcp` for OAuth.
- **Honest about Claude Code permission prompts** — the new prompt warns the user that install.sh fires many sub-commands (brew, npm, cargo, pip, uv) and Claude Code may prompt for each Bash type. Sets expectations so the user doesn't think the installer is broken.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **README install section rewritten with three explicit tiers** — Minimal (chief-of-staff + design only, ~5 min, ~5 MB), Lite CCv4 (`--no-fastedit-model`, ~10-15 min, ~500 MB), Full (`./scripts/install.sh`, ~20-40 min, ~5 GB). Replaces two contradictory install sections from v0.1.12 that documented different flows on different pages. Each tier explicitly lists what tools land on disk, what skills become available, and approximate wall time. No script changes — `install.sh --no-fastedit-model` already handled the Lite tier; the fix is honesty in the docs.
- **Skill count claim corrected** — README now says "Skills (66 total)" instead of the stale "57 total" carried over from v0.1.11. The +9 is the ContinuousClaude V4.7 pipeline bundled in v0.1.12 (autonomous, autonomous-research, bootup, create-handoff, premortem, research, resume-handoff, review, upgrade-harness).
- **Skills category table** gains a "ContinuousClaude V4.7 pipeline (9)" row enumerating the bundled skills, so fork users can see what they get from each install tier.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **One-command installer** — `./scripts/install.sh` orchestrates an 11-step setup for fresh forks. Detects existing tooling (Homebrew, Claude Code, samba-onboarding artifacts via `gh + gws + claude` on PATH) and skips foundation steps when already configured. Idempotent at every step — safe to re-run. Flags: `--no-fastedit-model` (skip the ~3GB FastEdit model), `--skip-api-keys` (write empty `.env` stubs), `--verbose`, `--reconfigure` (re-prompt for keys), `--help`.
- **`scripts/lib/` — 12 installer modules.** Four copied verbatim from samba-onboarding (`ui.sh`, `detect.sh`, `prereqs.sh`, `claude.sh`). Eight new CCv4-specific modules: `sys-extras.sh` (ripgrep/ffmpeg/yt-dlp), `rust.sh`, `uv.sh`, `ccv4-bins.sh` (bloks + tldr-cli via cargo), `ccv4-python.sh` (requirements.txt + `fastedits[mlx,mcp]` via uv pip install --system, handles PEP 668), `fastedit-mcp.sh` (idempotent `.mcp.json` edit via jq), `api-keys.sh` (interactive prompts for 5 keys), `verify.sh` (binary probes + manual OAuth checklist).
- **`scripts/lib/CONVENTIONS.md`** — codifies the installer-lib conventions: 1-arg `step()` banner form, one function per lib, idempotency via presence-check, bash-3.2 portability, env-var cross-lib comms.
- **`INSTALL.md`** — manual install fallback for users who prefer step-by-step control over `install.sh`. ~220 lines: prerequisites, 11-step install, post-install OAuth (Slack/Figma/GWS), troubleshooting.
- **CCv4 hooks bundled in-repo.** `.claude/settings.json` declares `statusLine` + 4 hook events using `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`: `PreToolUse:Read→tldr-read`, `PreCompact→pre-compact`, `PostToolUse:Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Update→post-edit-diagnostics`, `Stop→auto-handoff-stop`. Existing `UserPromptSubmit:intent-detector` preserved.
- **`.env.example` rewritten** with 5 CCv4 keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, `NIA_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, `ATLASSIAN_BASIC_AUTH`) and acquisition URLs for each.

### Changed

- **`extract-template.sh`** appends 9 CCv4 skills to `SHIPPED_SKILLS` (autonomous, autonomous-research, bootup, create-handoff, premortem, research, resume-handoff, review, upgrade-harness) and adds a `PHASE 2.5` block that copies hooks (5 mjs + 2 lib mjs), Python tools (4 files), `.claude/settings.json`, `scripts/install.sh`, and `scripts/lib/*.sh` into the export tree.
- **`TOOLS.md`** new "ContinuousClaude V4.7 bundle" section listing the 9 skills, 5+2 hooks, 4 Python tools, and the installer.
- **`README.md` project map** expanded with `.claude/{skills,hooks,tools}/` and `scripts/` lines; new Quick Reference row pointing fork users at `./scripts/install.sh`.

### Fixed

- **`ui.sh` exports `die` and `err`** — samba's `ui.sh` only defined `info`/`warn`, but CCv4 libs assumed all four. Calls to `die` crashed with `die: command not found` on error paths. Added one-line `err()` and `die()`.
- **PEP 668 / externally-managed-environment** — macOS Homebrew Python now refuses `pip install` system-wide. `ccv4-python.sh` switched to `uv pip install --system` with `--break-system-packages` fallback. uv is already a hard dep (installed at step 6).
- **`verify_all` respects `--no-fastedit-model`** — was flagging `fastedit` as MISSING and returning exit 1 even when the flag intentionally skipped its install. Now conditional on `NO_FASTEDIT_MODEL=0`.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **SKILL.md frontmatter cleanup** — verified the spec against authoritative Claude Code docs and corrected the harness:
  - Removed `context: fork` from 14 first-party skills. The field is real but only takes effect when paired with `agent:` — without that companion, Claude Code silently ignores it. Was vestigial.
  - Added per-skill `allowed-tools` to 15 high-impact skills (briefing, bootstrap, find, contact, contact-log, new-project, archive-project, prune-projects, inbox-process, save-resource, sync-indexes, thinking-partner, samba-publish, company-research, people-research). `allowed-tools` is the real Claude Code field that grants no-prompt access to listed tools when a skill is active. Total skills with `allowed-tools`: 4 → 19.
- **Trimmed top-5 SKILL.md descriptions** that were exceeding the per-entry cap and suppressing other skills from the session-start listing:
  - `briefing` 2941 → 803 chars
  - `bootstrap` 2921 → 897 chars
  - `contact-log` 2006 → 658 chars
  - `contact` 1743 → 754 chars
  - `inbox-process` 1609 → 630 chars (was being dropped entirely)
  - Net ~7,478 chars / ~1,870 tokens reclaimed. Trigger phrases, invariants, composition notes, and historical pointers moved out of the description into the SKILL.md body where they belong.
- **`/briefing` v0.2.0** — output switched from `morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.md` to `morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. Full DOM with `data-od-id` slugs follows the `design-dashboard` pattern (sidebar nav + topbar + KPI row + section panels + Tools-used footer). Self-contained: no `<script>`, no external links/fonts/CSS, no `http://` refs, inline SVG only.
- **Atlassian skill scripts parameterized** — `jira-create-vertical-slices/scripts/create_slices.py`, `scaffold-engineering-project/scripts/scaffold.py`, and `confluence-publish-markdown/scripts/publish_markdown.py` now read `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL` (and `ATLASSIAN_CONF_SPACE` for the latter) from env with `<your-org>` placeholder fallback. No more hardcoded `sambatv.atlassian.net` references.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

First public release — the daily-agents harness extracted from Sid's private workspace.

### Added

- PARA workspace skeleton: `0-Inbox/` / `1-Projects/` / `2-Coding/` (`work`, `personal`, `forks`, `archive`) / `3-Resources/` (`contacts`, `meetings`, `reference`, `research`, `templates`, `design-systems`) / `4-Archive/`.
- Interactive `/bootstrap` skill — first-run setup walking through identity, persona, design-system pick, workspace skeleton, and tool detection. Tiger invariants T1–T4: never overwrites edited persona files, refuses to re-run on a configured fork without `--reconfigure`, never auto-commits, never installs tools.
- 74 shipped skills across 5 categories:
  - **15 first-party lifecycle**: `archive-project`, `bootstrap`, `briefing`, `budget-tracker`, `contact`, `contact-log`, `desktop-organizer`, `find`, `inbox-process`, `new-project`, `prune-projects`, `save-resource`, `skill-creator`, `sync-indexes`, `thinking-partner`.
  - **2 research**: `company-research`, `people-research`.
  - **3 Atlassian**: `confluence-publish-markdown`, `jira-decompose-epic`, `scaffold-engineering-project`.
  - **36 design**: `saas-landing`, `dashboard`, `blog-post`, `hyperframes`, `video`, etc.
  - **10 persona**: `exec-assistant`, `sales-ops`, `content-creator`, `project-manager`, `team-lead`, `hr-coordinator`, `it-admin`, `customer-support`, `event-coordinator`, `researcher`.
  - **1 samba-publish**: reference SSO-gated Cloudflare Pages publisher — non-Samba forks adapt domain + token.
- 73-brand design-system library — swap the active brand with `/use-design <brand>`.
- Dual-folder memory model — auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` (per-machine, `MEMORY.md` index) plus a curated git-tracked `memory/` folder (daily logs, writing-style, learned-preferences).
- `intent-detector.mjs` hook v1 (fork-portable, passive logging).
- `gemini-vision` MCP server (free Gemini tier, multi-modal: image / OCR / document / video / YouTube).

### Not shipped (intentional)

- `gws-*` + `recipe-*` skills (47) — install the `gws` CLI separately to pick these up.
- `*-workspace` eval scratch directories (6).
